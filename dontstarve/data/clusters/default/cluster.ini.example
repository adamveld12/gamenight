[MISC]

max_snapshots

    Default: 6
    Maximum number of snapshots to retain. These snapshots are created every time a save occurs, and are available in the “Rollback” tab on the “Host Game” screen.


[SHARD]

shard_enabled

    Default: false
    Enable server sharding. This must be set to true for multi-level servers. For single-level servers, it can be omitted.


bind_ip

    Overridable in server.ini
    Default: 127.0.0.1
    Required: If shard_enabled = true and is_master = true
    This is the network address the master server will listen on for other shard servers to connect to. Set this to 127.0.0.1 if all of your servers in your cluster are on the same machine, or 0.0.0.0 if the servers in your cluster are on different machines. This only needs to be set for the master server, either in cluster.ini, or the master server's server.ini.


master_ip

    Overridable in server.ini
    Default: none
    Required: If shard_enabled = true and is_master = false
    This is the I.P. address that a non-master shard will use when trying to connect to the master shard. If all servers in a cluster are on the same machine, set this to 127.0.0.1


master_port

    Overridable in server.ini
    Default: 10888
    This is UDP port that the master server will listen on, and that a non-master shard will use when trying to connect to the master shard. This should be set to the same value for all shards by having a single entry in cluster.ini, or omitted completely to use the default.


cluster_key

    Overridable in server.ini
    Default: none
    Required if shard_enabled = true
    This is a password used to authenticate a slave server to the master. If you are running servers on different machines that need to connect to each other, this value must be the same on each machine. For servers running on the same machine, you can just set this once in cluster.ini.


[STEAM]

steam_group_only

    Default: false
    When set to true, the server will only allow connections from players belonging to the steam group listed in the steam_group_id setting.


steam_group_id

    Default: 0
    Steam group id for steam_group_only / steam_group_admins settings. See here for instructions on finding your steam group id: http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/55994-server-admin-associate-your-server-with-a-steam-group/


steam_group_admins

    Default: false
    When this is set to true, admins of the steam group specified in steam_group_id will also have admin status on the server.


[NETWORK]

offline_server

    Default: false
    Create an offline server. The server will not be listed publicly, and only players on the local network will be able to join, and any steam-related functionality will not work.


tick_rate

    Default: 15
    This is the number of times per-second that the server sends updates to clients. Increasing this may improve precision, but will result in more network traffic.


whitelist_slots

    Default: 0
    The number of reserved slots for whitelisted players. To whitelist a player, add their Klei UserId to the whitelist.txt file (Place this file in the same directory as cluster.ini)


cluster_password

    Default: none
    This is the password that players must enter to join your server. Leave this blank or omit it for no password.


cluster_name

    Default: false
    When set to true, the server will only accept connections from machines on the same LAN


cluster_intention

    Default: Varies, depending on game mode.

    The maximum number of players that may be connected to the cluster at one time.
