# Game Night

[![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/adamveld12/gamenight/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adamveld12/gamenight/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml)

A bunch of containerized dedicated servers for games I play on the reg.

- Upcoming Games
    - Arma 3 - 233780
    - Don't Starve Together - 343050
    - Stationeers - 600760
    - Project Zomboid - 223250
    - Killing Floor - 222860


## How to use

You will need docker or some other container runtime capable of running docker images installed.

For the most part all of these follow some a similar pattern:

```
/data
    |__configs/ <- server configs go here
    |__logs/    <- log files should appear here where necessary, otherwise logs will appear in stdout
    |__mods/    <- if the game supports mods, they would go here
    |__saves/   <- game saves are made here
/games
    |__<game_name>/ <- executables and game install lives here
```

- There is a linux user and group named after the specified game (IE for Factorio there is a factorio user)
- All of the configuration files should get mounted into `/data/configs`

- All containers have configs with sane defaults which should allow you to launch them without configuration

- You should be able to simply run the containers, export the proper ports and everything will run without much else required

- If you don't have access to config files I've included defaults in the images so you can use them as reference

### Factorio

PORTS 34197/udp

```
DEFAULT_SAVE_FILE=game_save // the game save file name, this save file is based in /data/saves
```

If the startup script sees a save file with a name matching the env var `DEFAULT_SAVE_FILE` it will tell the server to load it
instead of generating a new one.

Mods can be copied into `/data/mods/` and the server will pick them up at launch

### Minecraft

PORTS 25565/tcp

```
JVM_MEMORY_SIZE=1024m // the memory allocation for the JVM see:  (https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server#Start_the_Minecraft_server)
```

Create your `server.properties` and mount it in `/data/configs/`

### Rust

PORTS 28015/udp 28016/tcp 28017/tcp

Create a server.cfg  and mount it in `/data/configs`.
You can find a selection of config properties here: [https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Rust_Dedicated_Server#Server_Commands](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Rust_Dedicated_Server#Server_Commands).

Note: do not put the `+` in your server.cfg, see the example below:

```
server.ip 0.0.0.0
server.port 28015
rcon.ip 0.0.0.0
rcon.port 28016
rcon.web 0
server.tickrate 10
server.hostname "Your Server Name"
server.identity "my_server_identity"
server.maxplayers 50
server.worldsize 3000
server.seed 50000
server.saveinterval 600
rcon.password "YourPassword"
```

### Terraria

PORT 7777/tcp

- Mount configs at `/data/configs`

- Saves are stored at `/data/saves`

- An example config is located at `/data/configs/serverconfig.example.txt`, you can pass config options to the container as parameters. The list of available parameters can be found [here](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Server#Command_line_parameters)

### SteamCMD

Useful for using as a base image for any game using steam. The entrypoint by default installs the specified APPID with steamcmd and then runs `/data/configs/configure.sh` which can then be used to launch the game or whatever else.

```
# the user name/pass used to authenticate with steam, some games require this before you can download the dedicated server executable
STEAM_USER="anonymous"
STEAM_PASS=""

APPID=<undefined>     # the app to install - see list of dedication server app IDs here: (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dedicated_Servers_List)
```

You can overwrite the `/data/configs/configure.sh` to run custom commands such as installing games or setting up complex things. This should not be necessary in the other images though


## Dwarf Fortress

Easy, just run it. Saves are `/games/df/data/save`.
